The ActionScript 3 language has influenced in the creation of Jet. ActionScript 3 was designed based on ECMAScript fourth edition, which has been abandoned by the TC39 committee. ActionScript 3 incorporated the ECMAScript for XML standard, which has been obsoleted and removed from supporting JavaScript engines. The Jet language extends and changes the ActionScript 3 language in several ways.

Since its release in 2006, ActionScript 3 has been popular for application development using the Flash Player runtime.

Just as ActionScript, Jet is not tied to Flash Player and its derivatives, and may be explored as a scripting language for other technologies such as Unreal Engine for simulations and videogames.
