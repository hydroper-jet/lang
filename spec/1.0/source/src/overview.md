# Overview

JetWork is a flexible, strongly typed, multi-purpose scripting language that strives to be in a balance between simplicity and performance.

The syntax for JetWork programs is designed to be as close as possible to the syntax from ActionScript 3 programs. The language attempts not to introduce unfamiliar syntax.
