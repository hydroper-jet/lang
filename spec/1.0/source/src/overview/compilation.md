# Compilation and transpilation

Jet can be compiled to other high-level languages or be executed by a virtual machine. For Jet support, a platform must provide its own compiler subset of the Jet Compiler that traverses the abstract syntax tree and reads compile-time symbols, producing evaluable code.

The Jet compiler subsets take the approach of traversing the abstract syntax tree instead of parsing from a generated bytecode due to special file extensions supported by frameworks such as XML components possibly containing Jet programs.
