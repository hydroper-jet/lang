# JetFlex

JetFlex is a future JetWork technology that allows developing interactive applications using the Adobe AIR platform.

JetFlex is not specified in the present. The expectation is that it is similiar to Apache Flex, and the JetWork compiler is able to compile both JetWork and JetFlex files.
