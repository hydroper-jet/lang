# JetWork Flex

JetWork Flex is a future JetWork technology that allows developing interactive applications using the Adobe AIR platform.

JetWork Flex is not specified in the present. The expectation is that it is similiar to Apache Flex, and the JetWork compiler will in the future be able to compile both JetWork and JetWork Flex XML files.
