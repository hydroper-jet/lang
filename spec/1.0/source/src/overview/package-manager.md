# Package manager

The language is integrated with a package manager with support for vital features:

* workspaces;
* specifying a dependency through a directory path;
* registry namespaces.

Registry namespaces allow distinguishing dependencies from different platforms; without registry namespaces, the registry can get cluttered over time and working with different platforms can be a confusing experience.

A particular package can only depend in two registry namespaces: `*` and another optional registry namespace specified by the package manifest's top-level `registryNamespace` option. The `*` registry namespace indicates that the package does not rely on a platform.

Here is an example of a potential package manifest that uses `http://www.w3.org/web` as its dependency namespace:

**package.json**

```json
{
    "id": "org.q.f",
    "registryNamespace": "http://www.w3.org/web",
    "dependencies": {
        "*": {
            "xml": "1.0.0",
        },
        "http://www.w3.org/web": {
            "goog.g": "1.0.0"
        }
    }
}
```

Note that registry namespaces are only defined by the registry maintainers, not by the developers.
