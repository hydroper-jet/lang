# Visibility

A visibility is either `public`, `private`, `protected` or `internal`.

* The `public` visibility indicates that a property is accessible from anywhere.
* The `private` visibility indicates that a property is accessible from within a class block.
* The `protected` visibility indicates that a property is accessible from a class and any subclasses.
* The `internal` visibility indicates that a property is accessible from the enclosing package, excluding subpackages.
